# Quantum-Spy-Detector
A Hackathon project created by sleepingcat4. It uses IBM Quantum Computers to detect Spy through fundamental QPU Instructions i.e. Combinations of HAD and READ Operator.

## About the project

Quantum Computer is a well-established theoretical computer science branch now. The program specifically focusesd on Qunatum Communication and a well-known "Man in the middle" hacking technique.
Through the project, I tried to explore the concept of Quantum Communication through HAD and READ QPU Instructions. 

Note: The project is also being submitted in World Coding Club Hackathon. The author reserves all rights to the code.
